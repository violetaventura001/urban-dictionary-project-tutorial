The definitive rapper, and in my opinion the definitive hero. [Tupac's] was one of the most beautiful souls ever to grace this planet. Everything he touched was art, he practically made the genre of gangsta rap, was a true genius and an extremely [good man] at heart. Complicated as he was, he fought and rapped for what he believed in and with an [unsurpassed] level of emotion. He's an icon and a legend to the growing society of African- Americans and anybody else who looks up to him. His legacy will unsurpassed by any before and afer him and no matter what the hell any of you think, and no matter what the hell happens Tupac will always THE hero and role model for me.
